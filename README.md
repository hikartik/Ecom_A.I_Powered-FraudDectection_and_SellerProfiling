## üöÄ Product Overview

Our platform offers a unified marketplace experience where:

- **Consumers** browse products annotated with AI-generated trust indicators‚Äîimage authenticity, description quality, and multimodal consistency.
- **Sellers** list new items through an intuitive interface that provides real-time AI feedback and quality scores before a listing goes live.
- **Administrators** oversee platform health via aggregated risk analytics and seller profiling, all built into the same product suite.

This end-to-end solution combines real-time inference, batch analysis, and graph-based modeling into a single, cohesive product.

## üîß Key Features

1. **Real-Time Listing Validation**

   - **Image Authenticity**: Detect manipulated or low-quality images using CLIP vision embeddings and a lightweight classification head.
   - **Description Quality**: Identify exaggeration, policy violations, or keyword stuffing via a fine-tuned BERT model.
   - **Multimodal Consistency**: Score alignment between visuals and text with CLIP multimodal embeddings.
   - **Unified Risk Score**: Aggregate vision, text, and consistency metrics through a weighted ensemble to generate a real-time risk indicator.

2. **Seller Onboarding & Feedback**

3. **Batch Review Analysis & Seller Profiling**

   - **Review Semantics**: Generate sentence-level embeddings (SentenceTransformers) and sentiment scores (BERT) for each review.
   - **Coherence Score**: Compute consistency across multiple reviews using combined semantic similarity and sentiment agreement.
   - **Heterogeneous Graph Risk Engine**: Build a seller‚Äìproduct‚Äìreview multimodal graph and apply a GAT-based GNN (PyTorch Geometric) to produce a comprehensive Seller Risk Score.

4. **Unified Administrative Insights**

   - **Aggregate Dashboards**: Searchable tables and charts for flagged listings, seller risk distribution, and marketplace trends.
