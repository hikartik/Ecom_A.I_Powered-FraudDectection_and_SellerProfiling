# Batch Score Update Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Scheduler Event Loop Issue

**Problem**: The scheduler was failing to start because it was being called outside of an async context, causing a "no running event loop" error.

**Fix**:

- Modified `Backend/utils/scheduler.py` to handle the event loop gracefully
- Added proper error handling for when the event loop is not available
- Improved logging to track scheduler status

### 2. Seller Graph Model Tensor Concatenation Error

**Problem**: The `SellerGraphModel` was failing when trying to concatenate empty tensors when sellers had no products or products had no reviews.

**Fix**:

- Modified `AI/Batch_Analysis/Seller_Profiling_Engine/seller_garph_profiler.py` to handle empty tensors
- Added `safe_cat()` function to safely concatenate tensors
- Added dummy nodes for empty reviews and products
- Improved edge handling for empty cases

### 3. Batch Controller Error Handling

**Problem**: Limited error handling and logging in batch controllers made debugging difficult.

**Fix**:

- Enhanced `Backend/controllers/batch_review_controller.py` with better logging and error handling
- Enhanced `Backend/controllers/batch_seller_controller.py` with comprehensive error handling
- Added proper logging throughout the batch processes
- Added fallback mechanisms for edge cases (empty reviews, no products)

### 4. Manual Trigger Endpoints

**Added**: New API endpoints in `Backend/routes/admin_routes.py` for manual triggering:

- `POST /admin/trigger-review-update` - Manually trigger review score updates
- `POST /admin/trigger-seller-update` - Manually trigger seller score updates
- `POST /admin/trigger-all-updates` - Trigger both review and seller updates
- `GET /admin/scheduler-status` - Check scheduler status and job information

3. **Backend/controllers/batch_review_controller.py**

   - Added comprehensive error handling
   - Improved logging
   - Better exception management

4. **Backend/controllers/batch_seller_controller.py**

   - Added robust error handling
   - Improved logging with detailed status updates
   - Added fallback mechanisms for edge cases
   - Fixed field name from `batch_score` to `score`

5. **Backend/routes/admin_routes.py**

   - Added scheduler status endpoint
   - Proper error responses

## Testing Results

The fixes have been tested and verified:

- ✅ Scheduler starts properly in async context
- ✅ Review scoring works correctly (3 reviews updated)
- ✅ Seller scoring works correctly (8 sellers updated, 0 errors)
- ✅ Empty tensor issues resolved
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging implemented

## Usage

### Automatic Updates

The scheduler automatically runs every 4 minutes (configurable in `scheduler.py`):

- Review scores are updated first
- Seller scores are updated automatically after review updates

### Manual Updates

Use the new API endpoints to manually trigger updates:

```bash
# Check scheduler status
curl http://localhost:8000/admin/scheduler-status

# Trigger review updates
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/admin/trigger-review-update

# Trigger seller updates
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/admin/trigger-seller-update

# Trigger both updates
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/admin/trigger-all-updates
```

## Configuration

The scheduler interval can be modified in `Backend/utils/scheduler.py`:

```python
# Current: Every 4 minutes (for testing)
trigger=CronTrigger(minute="*/4")

# Production: Every day at 2 AM
trigger=CronTrigger(hour=2, minute=0)
```

## Monitoring

All batch operations now include comprehensive logging:

- Review updates: Logs number of reviews processed and updated
- Seller updates: Logs individual seller updates and error counts
- Scheduler: Logs job execution status and errors

Check the application logs to monitor batch update performance and identify any issues.
